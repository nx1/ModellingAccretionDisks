Accretion Power in Astrophysics:
Chapter 1:
    1.1
    Each accretor type has different timeframes assocated with the processes 
    within in based usually on mass.
    
    1.2
    Eddington Limit is the maximum luminosity f accretion, it arises as a result
    of force balance.
    
    1.3
    We can treat the the spectrum of an acreting object as a being emitted like
    a blackbody. This can be linked to it's luminosity. (eq 1.10)

    We may also define a temperature that the accreted material would reach if 
    all of it's GPE was converted into thermal energy.
    
    white dwarfs should be optical,ultra violet and possibly Xray sources.
    
Chapter 2:
    2.1
    Accreting matter is gaseous and only interacts via collisions.
    
CHAPTER 5:
    5.1
    The thin disk approximation can be made
    
    Much of the present interest in accretion discs stems from the encouraging
    results of comparison between this theory and observations of close binary systems.
