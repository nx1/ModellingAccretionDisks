==============DEADLINES==============
Deadlines for MPhys projects of 2017-2018 academic year :


Progress Report:					(Check progress report doc file)
	-Tuesday 9th  January 2018    	(EXAM SEASON AROUND THIS TIME)
	An earlier deadline may be preferable and possible since it is mearly a progress report.
		Your progress report should describe:

			* the background necessary to put the project in context
			* the aims and objectives of the project
			* the methods chosen to achieve those aims
			* the progress that has been made to date
			* what remains to be done and how it is intended to complete the project on time

	
	
Submission of Final Report and Project Summary Report: 
	-Thursday 19th April 2018 
Interviews: 
	-During the weeks beginning 23rd April, and 30th April 2018
=====================================



============General Coding============

The prerequisites outlined below cover such matters as:

    -how is development structured? (life cycle)
    -what is the software meant to do? (requirements)
    -the overall structure of the software system (architecture)
    -more detailed design of individual components (design)
    -choice of programming language(s)
		Python 2.7


Python Code Layout
From: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction
      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/			<-- memes

Indentation:
	-Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
	-Spaces are the preferred indentation method.

Blank Lines:
	-Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
	
Comments:
	-Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.
	-Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!
	
Naming Conventions:
	-b (single lowercase letter)		(Counters and other such variables)
	-B (single uppercase letter)		(Counters and other such variables)
	-lowercase							(module names?) 
	-lower_case_with_underscores		(module names?) 
	-UPPERCASE							(Physical Constants? Global Variables?) eg. Viscocity? or Gravitational constant?
	-UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES		(Physical Constants)
	
	-Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
	-Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.

General Concepts:
	-One statement per line
	-when using if statements, you don't need to check if it's true eg:
				# Just check the value
				if attr:
					print 'attr is truthy!'

				# or check for the opposite
				if not attr:
					print 'attr is falsey!'
					
					
	
Modular based code using subroutines/functions is preferred for versatillity and cleanliness

============General Physics============
"explain the spectral-timing properties of the X-ray variability"


"Most of the variability power is in the form of aperiodic fluctuations
that span several orders of magnitude in temporal frequency"

"3 - 80M_sol black holes are created through the collapse of Massive stars" (Well established)

Supermassive black holes 10^6 - 10^9 however are not so established

They may form through the merger of ~10^2 –
10^5 M? IMBHs (Ebisuzaki et al. 2001). IMBHs
are thus a crucial missing link between stellar-
mass and supermassive BHs, with likely environ-
ments for their formation including globular clus-
ters

--> circular vs elliptical disks?


Angular momentum revision needed.
	-Mass has more angular momentum when it is further from the center? L = r x parameter
	-

CreateDisk( Variables )
Built in variables for main sequence star (different masses), white dwarfs, neutron stars, stellar mass black holes, supermassive black holes. 
What is different except mass?  --> composition?

Mass of Accretor Function

"An accretion disc with an "slpha" parameter fluctuating at different is considered." - 


http://qxyang.lamost.org/uploads/books/Accretion_Power_in_Astrophysics.pdf



--> Save state at each time interval so one can revert back and create a new evolution from a pre existing state?




---------------------------
Simple Maths:

A body of mass M and Radius R the gravitational potential Energy released by the accretion of mass m is

\Delta E_{acc} = \frac{GMm}{R}

============Knigge Email============
• Decide on the physical system we're modelling 
	o Accretor type 
		? main sequence star 
		? white dwarf 
		? neutron star
		? stellar mass black hole 
		? supermassive black hole 
	o Based on accretor type (and system), decide on 
		? Mass of accretor 
		? Radius of accretor = inner radius of accretion disk 
		? Outer radius of accretion disk 
		? Average accretion rate through the disk
• Set up a model disk consisting of N annuli 
	o the spacing/size of the annuli is important! 
	o as a starting point, use spacing/size constant in log(R) 
		? i.e. constant *ratio* -- R_i+1/R_i = constant 
• Work out the effective temperature at each radius according to standard thin disk theory 
	o T_eff(R) ~ R^{-3/4}    (at R >> R_in) 
• Work out the disk spectrum by integrating over the disk 
	o Assume blackbody radiation: B_nu(T_eff) 
• Work out the viscous time-scale at each disk radius 
• Generate local Mdot fluctuations at each radius 
	o As a starting point, assume mdot(r_j,t) is a sinusoid with period equal to the viscous time-scale 
	o Code things with a view to making this more general/complex in future 
• Work out the overall Mdot fluctuation at each radius 
	o Eq 1 in Arevalo & Uttley 
• Work out the resulting light curves 
	o bolometric: L(r_j,t) ~ Mdot(r_j,t) 
	o monochromatic: based on BB spectrum 
• Plot the light curves 
• Create and inspect power spectra 
• Plot rms vs flux

============Knigge Questions============

any prefered format?
why in New zealand?

"the country -- in New Zealand -- between mid-January and end of April of next year."

propose times
NZ is +13
UK is +1
12 hours difference between

9am UK = 9pm NZ		(SAME DAY)
10pm AUS = 10am UK 	(SAME DAY)

29th October 2017 




any paticular journal/citation style?

Is putting the project publicly available on GitHub a bad idea?
Can we add you to the GitHub?
